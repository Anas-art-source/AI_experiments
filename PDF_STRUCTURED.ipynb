The complaint of unfair dismissal is well-founded. The claimant was \\nunfairly dismissed. \\n \\n2. The respondent unreasonably failed to comply with the ACAS Code of \\nPractice on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures 2015 and it is just and \\nequitable to increase the compensatory award payable to the claimant by \\n20% in accordance with s 207A Trade Union & Labour Relations \\n(Consolidation) Act 1992 \\n \\n3. The claimant caused or contributed to the dismissal by blameworthy \\nconduct and it is just and equitable to reduce the basic and compensatory \\naward payable to the claimant by 40%. \\n \\n4. The complaint of wrongful dismissal in breach of contract in relation to \\nnotice pay is well-founded. \\n \\n5. The complaint in respect of holiday pay is well-founded. The \\nrespondent failed to pay the claimant in accordance with regulation 14(2) \\nand/or 16(1) of the Working Time Regulations 1998. \\n \\n6. As the judgment deals with liability only, a notice of hearing to \\ndetermine remedy and any case management orders will be sent \\nseparately. \\n \\n \\nREASONS  \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017  \\nIntroduction  \\n1. The respondent operates as a Country Club in Cambridge offering a \\nnumber of leisure facilities including golf and spa facilities to visitors and \\nmembers.  The claimant was employed by the respondent as a \\nprofessional golfer from 17 May 2010 to 7 June 2022.  The claimant was \\ndismissed by the respondent for gross misconduct.  The claimant brings \\nclaims for unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal and unpaid holiday pay. \\n \\nClaims and Issues   \\n2. The claimant brings the following claims: Unfair Dismissal, Wrongful \\ndismissal and Holiday Pay.  \\n \\n1. The list of issues were agreed at the outset of the hearing as follows: \\n \\nUnfair Dismissal  \\n3.1 Has the respondent shown the reason for dismissal? \\n \\nThe respondent relies on gross misconduct as the reason for  \\n dismissal in that the claimant (para 33 of Response): \\n \\na. ‘Made unwanted advances of a sexual nature to fellow   \\n employees.’  \\n \\nb. ‘Made unwanted statements in reference to a fellow employee  \\n having a resemblance to Jimmy Saville.’    \\n \\n3.2 Was the reason a potentially fair reason of a kind that can justify  \\n dismissal under sections 98(1) and (2) of the Employment Rights  \\n Act 1996? \\n \\n3.3 If so, was the dismissal fair or unfair within section 98(4), and did  \\n the respondent in all respects act within the band of reasonable  \\n responses?  \\n \\nFollowing the test in BHS v Burchell test: \\na) Did the respondent genuinely believe the claimant was guilty of \\ngross misconduct? \\nb) Did the respondent hold that belief based on reasonable \\ngrounds? \\nc) Did the respondent carry out a reasonable and sufficient \\ninvestigation? \\nd) Was the decision to dismiss a fair sanction i.e. within the range \\nof reasonable responses for a reasonable employer? \\ne) Was the process procedurally fair? \\n \\nA key issue is whether the Claimant’s conduct was reasonably \\ncategorised as gross misconduct by the respondent in accordance \\nwith the respondent’s disciplinary policy?  \\n \\nRemedy  \\n3.4 Does the claimant wish to be reinstated or re engaged? \\nIf there is a compensatory award – how much should it be? \\nWhat financial losses has the dismissal caused? \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 Has the claimant taken reasonable steps to replace lost earnings? \\n \\n \\nPolkey \\n3.5 If the dismissal was procedurally unfair, does the Respondent show \\n   that if there had been a fair procedure the Claimant would have  \\n  been dismissed in any event and when (Polkey v AE Dayton   \\n  Services Limited [1988] ICR 142 )? \\n \\nAcas Code  \\n3.6 The claimant seeks an uplift for failure to comply with Acas Code –  \\n  did the respondent unreasonably fail to comply in respect of: \\n\\uf0b7 Carrying out all necessary investigations (para 5)? \\n\\uf0b7 insufficient notice of the disciplinary meeting (para 11)? \\n\\uf0b7 if found the dismissal was for reasons other than in the \\ndismissal letter, not informing the claimant of all of the reasons \\nfor dismissal (para 22)? \\n \\nIf so, is it just and equitable to increase any award payable to the  \\n claimant? \\n \\nContributory conduct  \\n3.7 If the dismissal was unfair did the Claimant contribute by culpable  \\n  or blameworthy conduct?   \\n \\nThe respondent says he breached the terms of his suspension and  \\n contacted others to remove items from the pro shop.  \\n \\nWrongful dismissal  \\n3.8 The claimant was dismissed without notice. He brings a wrongful  \\n dismissal (breach of contract) claim in respect of his entitlement to  \\n 12 weeks’ statutory notice.  The respondent says that it was entitled \\n  to dismiss him without notice for his gross misconduct.   \\n \\nWhat was the claimant’s notice period? \\nWas he paid for that notice period? \\nIf not, was the claimant guilty of Gross Misconduct such that the \\nrespondent was entitled to dismiss without notice?  \\n \\nHoliday Pay – Working Time Regulations 1998  \\n3.9 In submissions Ms Webber clarified the claimant\\'s claim for holiday  \\n  pay under the WTR. He claims the maximum of 1.6 weeks or 8  \\n  days that can be carried over by agreement from 2021, as agreed  \\n  between the parties and claims 12 days accrued untaken holiday in \\n   2022 to the point of dismissal on 7 June 2022, so 20 days in total.  \\n \\nDid the respondent fail to pay the claimant for annual leave that had \\n  accrued but was untaken when the claimant’s employment ended? \\n \\nProcedure and evidence heard  \\n2. At the outset of the hearing, the parties agreed that the correct name of \\nthe respondent is Cambridge Country Club Ltd. The list of issues as \\noutlined above was also agreed at the outset of hearing.  I had before me \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 a bundle of documents of 168 pages.  There were five witness statements \\nand I heard oral evidence from the claimant and Ms Virgo for the claimant \\nand for the respondent from Mr McDonald, who carried out the disciplinary \\ninvestigation and dismissed the claimant, Mr Flanagan who was the \\nappeal manager and Ms Violo-Hitch, Finance and HR Manager.  I heard \\noral submissions from Mr Hine for the respondent and Miss Webber for \\nthe claimant. \\n \\nSummary Findings of Fact \\n3. I set out the following findings of fact which I determined as relevant to the \\nissues.  I am not making findings of fact on all the points in dispute \\nbetween the parties, only those that are relevant to the issues in the case \\nas now identified. \\n \\n4. The respondent operates as a Country Club in Cambridge offering a \\nnumber of leisure facilities including golf and spa facilities to visitors and \\nmembers. \\n \\n5. The Claimant has been a Professional Golfers Association (PGA) \\nProfessional for 28 years, and was employed by the Respondent from 17 \\nMay 2010 to 7 June 2022 as a Golf Professional. The Claimant’s duties \\nincluded running the Golf Shop, providing golf lessons and repairing \\ngolfing equipment. \\n \\n6. Prior to the disciplinary action taken in May 2022 leading to his dismissal \\non 7 June 2022, the claimant had a clean disciplinary record and had not \\nbeen subject to any investigation or received any informal or formal \\nwarnings during his employment. \\n \\nGrievances  \\n7. On 26 April 2022 Ms Clark, then Front of House Manager, submitted a \\nwritten grievance to Ms Violo-Hitch (at the time Accounts Assistant for the \\nRespondent) relating to inappropriate comments made by the claimant, \\nnamely: on one occasion in the pro golf shop in front of other colleagues \\nsaying that she smelt so good he could ‘lick [her] all over’, and twice \\nmessaging her late at night at 11pm on social media. She also referred to \\nhim being unhelpful and rude to her the previous day, on 25 April 2022, \\nrelating to work matters.   \\n \\n8. On 11 May 2022 Ms Violo-Hitch, submitted a written grievance to Mr \\nMcDonald (General manager) relating to the Claimant’s behaviour as \\nbeing inappropriate and not very professional, referring to: a GDPR issue \\nshe raised with the claimant, resulting in an argument with him in the pro \\ngolf shop; and that on the evening of 10 May 2022, when she was having \\na drink in Spike’s bar (which is a bar used by staff and members on the \\nrespondent’s premises), the claimant made a loud comment across the \\nbar about her and a member and that it was reported to her by another \\nmember that evening that the claimant had been making comments to \\nothers referring to her association with members and colleagues and her \\npersonal relationships. \\n \\n9. On 12 May 2022 Ms Wilkins, receptionist for the respondent, submitted a \\nformal complaint to Ms Ziolo-Hitch relating to inappropriate behaviour by \\nthe claimant in relation to:  messages sent to her via facebook on 11 \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 February 2022 insinuating that she was welcome round to his house for an \\nevening; and that on the evening of 10 May 2022 when she was in Spike’s \\nBar with her children, the claimant was sitting nearby with a colleague and \\nmembers, speaking about liking children and making comments referring \\nto Jimmy Saville that she felt he had taken it too far and that she generally \\nfelt uncomfortable due to his sexual innuendos, inappropriate jokes and \\ncomments about women. \\n \\n10. All three grievances were brought to Mr McDonald’s attention by Ms Viola-\\nHitch on 12 May 2022.    Mr McDonald summarises the complaints raised \\nat paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of his witness statement and there were eight \\nallegations in total under investigation that he put forward to the claimant. \\nHe also received screen shots of the messages between the claimant and \\nMs Wilkins (at page 64 of the bundle) and of the facebook message to Ms \\nClark (at page 65) from Ms Violo-Hitch on the same day. \\n \\n11. Mr McDonald first stated in evidence at the hearing that he did not speak \\nto the three individuals who raised the grievances, though later in \\nevidence he said that once the allegations were raised, they gave him \\nwritten statements and he spoke to them and spoke to the claimant.  He \\ndid not have any notes of these conversations and confirmed that he did \\nnot take any notes. When challenged that if he had new information from \\nthese conversations, it was not provided to the claimant, he stated that \\nthere was no new information provided. \\n \\nSuspension  \\n12. On 20 May 2022, the claimant was suspended by Laura Stephens, Duty \\nmanager.  He was given a letter confirming his suspension pending \\ninvestigations into allegations of ‘i nappropriate conduct ’.  In the letter, he \\nwas instructed “not to contact or to attempt to contact or influence anyone \\nconnected with the investigation in any way or to discuss this matter with \\nany other employee or client”.  He was further advised that “if there is \\nanyone whom you feel could provide a witness statement which would \\nhelp in investigating the allegations against you, then please contact me \\nand I will arrange for them to be interviewed.”    \\n \\n13. On 23 May 2022, the claimant received a letter from Mr McDonald inviting \\nhim to a disciplinary investigation meeting. The letter set out the \\nallegations under investigation as follows: \\n“It is alleged that whilst on duty, you made unwanted advances of a sexual \\n  nature to fellow employees. The company alleges that this allegation  \\n amounts to an assault of an indecent nature and, if substantiated in any  \\n way, represents a gross breach of trust and confidence and a breach of        \\nour duty of care to provide a safe working environment to our  \\n employees.”  \\n \\n14. The letter was dated 23 March 2022 and referred to 24 March 2022 as the \\ndate of the investigation meeting.   The claimant says this is evidence of \\nan intention to get rid of him and the outcome of the disciplinary \\ninvestigation being pre-determined.  The respondent says this was a \\nsimple error.  Having found that the grievances were brought to Mr \\nMcDonald’s attention on 12 May 2023, on balance I do not find that such \\nerrors are evidence that dismissal was predetermined in March 2023 but \\nrather that they show a lack attention to detail and of due care for the \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 process on Mr McDonald’s part, as did similar errors later including dates \\nin the letter inviting the claimant to the disciplinary hearing.   \\n \\n15. The claimant also contended that there was an intention to force him out \\nas he had been requested and refused to take a pay cut and the \\nrespondent was in financial difficulties.  Mr McDonald denied this. He \\nagreed there had been discussions about changing the basis of the \\nclaimant\\'s remuneration but that both parties had engaged in these \\ndiscussions and the claimant put forward proposals that ultimately were \\nnot taken forward.  He denied that there was any attempt to force out the \\nclaimant for refusing to take a pay cut and that in dismissing him, they had \\nbeen without a professional golfer for several months and had lost income. \\nI accept Mr McDonald’s evidence on this. \\n \\n16. On 24 May 2022, the claimant attended an investigation meeting with Mr \\nMcDonald. He was unaccompanied and there was no note taker \\naccompanying Mr McDonald. The claimant was not provided with copies \\nof the three written grievances or the screenshots of messages prior to or \\nat the investigation meeting. The meeting was recorded and a transcript \\nprepared by the Claimant’s solicitors was accepted by both parties at \\npages 91-97 of the Bundle.  A shorter transcript prepared by the \\nRespondent was included at pages 77-90. \\n \\n17. Mr McDonald explained to the claimant that he had received three \\ncomplaints from different people about work related issues.  He said the \\nprimary complaint was from Ms Clark and he related the allegation \\nregarding the ‘lick you all over’ comment that she said had been made by \\nhim.  The claimant denied that he had made the comment and stated that \\nit was not true. \\n \\n18. Mr McDonald related the second allegation made by Ms Clark that he had \\nsent a couple of messages late at night on social media and that she had \\nnot responded but thought things had ‘got out of hand’. \\n \\n19. The claimant said when Ms Clark started he thought they were friends, \\nand if talking about messages on social media, anyone could see them \\nand there was nothing in that.  He went on to say that he felt the complaint \\nfrom Ms Clark was due to a clash of personalities ‘business wise’ and to a \\nbreakdown in their working relationship after Ms Clark was promoted, in \\nrelation to her trying to take charge in the shop and with the golf societies.  \\nHe referred to emails of her getting involved in such matters and \\nsuggested to Mr McDonald that if he looked at the emails he would see \\nthat, as he was copied into them (emails dated 10 May 2022 pages 73-\\n79). \\n \\n20. Mr McDonald noted that the claimant acknowledged that there were \\nmessages and asked if he recalled saying anything.  The claimant said \\n‘no’ and denied making the ‘lick you all over’ comment, asking if there was \\na witness or if he could tell him where it was and who was there.  The \\nclaimant acknowledged complimenting Ms Clark once on the front of \\nhouse staff looking smart and that she always looked smart and well \\nturned out and was a great ambassador for the company.  He referred to \\ntheir working relationship breaking down and referred to an email when he \\nhad copied her in as the ‘main receptionist’ and that she had a go at him, \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 sending a reply pointing out that she was ‘duty manager’ (email dated 26 \\nApril 2022 page 70-71 of the bundle).   \\n \\n21. The claimant also said that if Mr McDonald interviewed other colleagues \\nthey would say there were tensions and he referred to Ms Virgo (who had \\nrecently left her job), who would speak to Mr McDonald privately.   \\n \\n22. The claimant suggested that as Ms Clark was leaving this was her way of \\n‘having a go’ at him.  Mr McDonald said that he would be going back to \\nspeak to Ms Clark following this. \\n \\n23. In his evidence at the hearing, Mr McDonald confirmed that he did not \\nspeak to Ms Clark after the investigation meeting. It was at this point in his \\nevidence that he said he had spoken to all three individuals when the \\ngrievances were raised, as I refer to above.  However, he confirmed that \\nhe never asked Ms Clark the date and time of the ‘lick you all over’ \\ncomment nor when it happened;  he confirmed that he never spoke to any \\ncolleagues (as referred to in Ms Clark’s written grievance), saying they \\nwere never identified;  and he confirmed that he never asked her about \\nthem. He accepted that he had no independent evidence of this comment \\nand that he did not independently verify it because he did not have the \\ndate and did not know who was on duty.  He did not speak to Ms Clark \\nafter the investigation meeting because she had left by then.  \\n \\n24. Mr McDonald next related the complaint raised by Ms Wilkins regarding \\nSpikes Bar and the allegation that the claimant made comments relating to \\nJimmy Saville that she said were inappropriate and that he was laughing \\nwith other people and it made her uncomfortable.  The claimant recalled \\nan occasion when he was in Spikes Bar with golf club members and \\nfriends and they were talking about the netflix programme about Jimmy \\nSaville.  He recalled that Joel Rickardson (another colleague) came to sit \\nwith them and asked if they were talking about Jimmy Saville and \\nsomeone in the group cracked a joke about it but the claimant said that it \\nwas nothing to do with Ms Clark and was not aimed at her.  He suggested \\nthat he could bring in witnesses to that. \\n \\n25. Mr McDonald asked if he had ever messaged Ms Wilkins outside of work \\nand the claimant confirmed that he had got messages and could provide \\nthese.  He recalled an occasion in the bar when he had said he was going \\nhome for a takeaway and to watch a film and she said she would love to \\ndo that;  that he had later sent a message saying she was always \\nwelcome to come round and when she did not reply, apologised if he had \\ngot the wrong idea and she said ‘no need to apologise’.   \\n \\n26. He said it was just for a friendly drink or meal in response to their earlier \\nconversation and that there was nothing out of hand and he felt there was \\nnothing wrong with that. Under cross examination, the claimant maintained \\nthat he did not think it inappropriate for him as a senior employee to \\nmessage a junior employee in this way, stating that Ms Wilkes socialised \\nin the bar in social hours with management and with him and he did not \\nsee a problem with that.  \\n \\n27. Mr McDonald related the third grievance raised by Ms Violo-Hitch that the \\nclaimant had been saying she was involved with golf club members.  The \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 claimant denied spreading rumours though said that he was aware of this \\nas it was on CCTV and others had been talking about it. \\n \\n28. Following the investigation meeting Mr McDonald confirmed he carried out \\nfurther investigation into two points.  Firstly, he looked at CCTV of Spikes \\nBar for the evening of 10 May 2022. \\n \\n29. Secondly, on reviewing the CCTV, Mr McDonald identified a member, Mr \\nSloman, who was in the bar that evening.  He called him and asked if he \\nrecalled that evening and asked him for a statement, which Mr Sloman \\nprovided in writing.   Mr Sloman said in his witness statement (page 80 of \\nthe bundle) that the claimant was drinking with a group of friends on a \\ntable near Ms Wilkins and made a comment likening himself to Jimmy \\nSaville which was targeted towards her.  \\n \\n30. Mr McDonald agreed that Mr Sloman was a friend of Ms Wilkins and when \\ncross examined as to why he did not speak to others in the bar that \\nevening, as seen in the CCTV footage, he said that he could not identify \\nanyone else.   \\n \\n31. Mr McDonald said at the hearing that he spoke to Joel Rickardson about \\nbeing in Spike’s bar the day before the disciplinary hearing and that Joel \\ndid not recall whether or not he was in the bar and could neither confirm \\nnor deny.  Mr McDonald did not take any notes of this conversation. \\n \\nDisciplinary Hearing  \\n32. On 31 May 2022 Mr McDonald sent a letter to the claimant inviting him to \\na disciplinary hearing.  The letter was dated 30 May 2022 and referred to a \\nhearing on 31 May 2022.   Mr McDonald accepted that the dates were \\nwrong and explained that the letter was prepared and sent to him by their \\nexternal HR advisers on 30 May 2022 and sent out by him to the claimant \\nby email on 31 May 2022 at 1.19pm for a hearing to be held at 3pm the \\nfollowing day (on 1 June 2022).    \\n \\n33. The letter set out the allegations against the claimant as follows: \\n \\n“It is alleged that on whilst on and off duty, you made unwanted advances \\n of a sexual nature to fellow employees. The company alleges that \\nthis allegation amounts to an assault of an indecent nature and, if \\nsubstantiated in any way, represents a gross breach of trust and \\nconfidence and a breach of our duty of care to provide a safe working \\nenvironment to our employees.”  \\n \\n\"It is alleged that on 10th May 2022 whilst in the Spikes bar, you made \\nunwanted statements in reference to a fellow employee having a \\nresemblance to Jimmy Saville. The company alleges that this allegation \\namounts to bullying and harassment that has caused mental discomfort \\namounting to an assault and, if substantiated in any way, represents a \\ngross breach of trust and confidence and a breach of our duty of care to \\nprovide a safe working environment to our employees.\"    \\n \\n“If these allegations are substantiated, we will regard them as gross \\nmisconduct. If you are unable to provide a satisfactory explanation, your \\nemployment may be terminated without notice.” \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017  \\n34. The claimant was provided with copies of the original grievance \\nstatements from Ms Clark, Ms Wilkins and Ms Violo-Hitch and a statement \\nfrom a member, Mr Sloman and abridged minutes of the investigation \\nmeeting largely excluding sections relating to the complaints raised by Ms \\nViolo-Hitch (pages 87-90).    \\n \\n35. Also included was a screenshot of the messages with Ms Wilkins dated 11 \\nFebruary 2022 as follows: \\nClaimant:  “Have a good night out That invite of a film and takeaway is  \\n   always there”  \\nClaimant:  “Oops” \\nMs Wilkins:  “Haha don’t worry! X”  \\nClaimant:      “ Sorry got wrong idea x”  \\nMs Wilkins:  “No need to apologise x”  \\n \\n36. And a screen shot of the facebook message to Ms Clark on 8 March 2022 \\nat 22:58: \\nClaimant:  “I have a question How do you manage to look so good   \\n   everyday”  \\n \\n37. This was the first time that the claimant was provided with copies of the \\noriginal complaints and the messages.  The claimant was not provided \\nwith any CCTV footage. \\n \\n38. The claimant was advised of his right to be accompanied and warned not \\nto contact or influence anyone involved in the investigation but if there \\nwere any employees he felt could provide a witness statement he should \\nadvise Mr McDonald who would arrange for them to be interviewed.  He \\nwas also warned that if he did not attend the disciplinary hearing without \\ngiving advance notice or good reason that would be treated as a separate \\nact of misconduct. \\n \\n39. The claimant emailed Mr McDonald at 15.13pm and given the short notice \\nrequested more time to prepare for the hearing and to give him enough \\nnotice to arrange for his PGA representative to accompany him.  This \\nrequest was denied by Mr McDonald, on the basis that he had given 24 \\nhours’ notice which was in line with the guidance and would not be able to \\nbring a PGA representative only a member of staff or member of a trade \\nunion.    \\n \\n40. The claimant agreed to attend the meeting but noted that as the letter he \\nreceived was dated 30 May 2022, it could have been sent to him the day \\nbefore, giving him more time to prepare.   \\n \\n41. The disciplinary hearing went ahead on 1 June 2022 and was held by Mr \\nMcDonald and the claimant was unaccompanied.  There was no note \\ntaker and the hearing was recorded.  The transcript in the Bundle was \\nsubsequently prepared by the claimant’s legal advisers for these \\nproceedings.   \\n \\n42. Mr McDonald first addressed two messages sent to Ms Clark.  The \\nclaimant explained that after becoming friends on facebook Ms Clark \\n‘waved’ at the claimant and he said ‘hello how are you’ or ‘hi what are you \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 up to’ and the second message (as detailed above), asking how she \\nmanaged to look so good everyday.  In his view the message containedno \\nsexual innuendo and he was saying how good she looked because she \\nwas always well turned out.   He did not think there was anything \\ninappropriate about the messages that he sent. The claimant maintained \\nthis position when cross examined during the tribunal hearing. \\n \\n43. Mr McDonald questioned him on the time that he sent the message \\npointing out that it was at 11pm at night and Ms Clark is married.  The \\nclaimant explained that he got in from work at 8pm in the evening and \\nwould mess about and carry on working and to him it was not unusual to \\nsend a message at that time of night and that it was on facebook and on \\nfriends and she never said anything about it. Mr McDonald put it to him \\nthat Ms Clark told him that she brought it up with management because \\nshe felt uncomfortable.  The claimant said there was no innuendo there. \\n \\n44. Mr McDonald referred to the complaint about the ‘lick you all over’ \\ncomment and the claimant denied that he said this and again asked for \\ndetails of the time and date.  Mr McDonald asked if he was aware of \\nmaking any other comments to Ms Clarke and the claimant responded \\n‘never have, no’.   He said that they used to chat as friends when she first \\ncame in.  In evidence at the hearing the claimant said that had such a \\ncomment been made in front of witnesses in the shop, it would have been \\ntalked about and spread through the golf club and people would have \\nknown about it. \\n \\n45. Mr McDonald asked about the message to Ms Wilkins inviting her for a \\ntakeaway and film. The claimant confirmed he sent it and again explained \\nthat it followed a conversation with her earlier in the evening from which he \\nunderstood that she would like to go round for a takeaway and film.  When \\nhe received no reply he acknowledged he had the wrong idea and he \\nreferred to her reply, ‘no need to apologise’ and said they left it there.  He \\nconfirmed there were no further messages sent.   \\n \\n46. Mr McDonald pointed out they had a duty of care to staff to give them an \\nenvironment where they could feel comfortable, happy, safe and that if you \\nare in a management position and for whatever reason, if staff are made \\nto feel uncomfortable, where the same thing happened previously a former \\ncolleague (previously mentioned by the claimant) sent inappropriate \\nmessages and was dismissed. In evidence at the hearing, he said the \\nformer colleague had resigned. \\n \\n47. Mr McDonald referred to the complaint made by Ms Wilkins about \\ncomments made in Spikes Bar relating to Jimmy Saville.  Based on the \\nclaimant\\'s explanation at the investigation meeting that Joel was there \\nwhen they spoke about Jimmy Saville and could confirm his explanation, \\nMr McDonald said that he had spoken to Joel who could not remember \\nbeing there on the date and could neither confirm nor deny. \\n \\n48. The claimant said that was because the conversation was not on the 10th \\nMay and that he had two witness statements that supported that. The \\nclaimant said that the date was wrong and that the conversation took \\nplace two weeks before that when they were talking about the netflix \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 documentary.  That his witnesses could recall the conversation and would \\nsay they were there and that Joel was there.   \\n \\n49. Mr McDonald said that he had gone back and reviewed CCTV and that \\nJoel was not there on 10th May.  The claimant repeated that it was \\nbecause it was not the 10th and the date was wrong.  Mr McDonald noted \\nthat he had spoken to one of the members who was there (Mr Sloman) \\nwho confirmed it. \\n \\n50. Mr McDonald asked the claimant where the claimant and his group were \\nsitting on the date he recalled and where Ms Wilkins was sitting.  The \\nclaimant confirmed she was sitting with her children and Ms Violo-Hitch, in \\nthe ‘usual corner’ on the left and that he and his group were sitting in the \\nbar at a table near the booths, about a table and half away from Ms \\nWilkins.  The claimant said that every Tuesday the members come down \\nfor the ‘drinkers club’ and they had signed statements and could confirm \\nthe dates and what happened and place Joel there and that they were \\ntalking about Jimmy Saville and that one of the guys had made a joke \\nwhen Joel walked in.  He reiterated that the respondent had the wrong \\ndate.   \\n \\n51. Mr McDonald responded that he had reviewed the CCTV and that the \\nstory did not stack up.  He had received a grievance saying this is the time \\nand date, he had reviewed the CCTV, spoken to someone he could see \\non the CCTV and said that they had confirmed the same thing to him, \\nreferring to the statement from Mr Sloman.   \\n \\n52. Mr McDonald confirmed that there was no need to go through the \\ncomplaints raised by Ms Violo-Hitch.  In his evidence at the hearing, he \\nexpalined that he did not pursue the third complaint from Ms Violo-Hitch \\nbecause there was not enough evidence and it was an instance of ‘he \\nsaid/she said’, so he disregarded it.  \\n \\n53. They discussed the claimant\\'s suggestion that he had already been \\nreplaced in his role by Mr Flannagan, who was in the Golf Pro shop and \\ndealing with suppliers.  Mr McDonald denied that was the case and that Mr \\nFlannagan was appointed as the General manager and was in charge of \\nthe whole building including dealing with the shop.  I accept his evidence \\non this.  \\n \\n54. Mr McDonald asked to go through the evidence that the claimant had \\nbrought with him to the hearing.  The claimant submitted a written defence \\nstatement setting out his position on all of the complaints and referenced \\nthe emails with Ms Clark (referred to above) showing the breakdown in \\nworking relationship.   \\n \\n55. He also submitted statements from witnesses including Mr Arkesden (a \\nmember), Mr Virgo (a former member) and three statements from Ms \\nVirgo (a former colleague and former member).  Two related to the \\nconversation in Spikes bar, with two witnesses recalling a conversation \\nabout Jimmy Saville in April 2022, when a comment was directed towards \\nJoel Rickardson.  Ms Virgo’s second statement related to the deteriorating \\nbreakdown in working relationships between the claimant and herself with \\nMs Clark and two statements (Ms Virgo’s and Mr Virgo’s) relating to Ms \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 Violo-Hitch\\'s complaints that were no longer under investigation.  The \\nclaimant also said that he had three more statements to come because \\npeople were away which is why he wanted to [respect] the meeting. \\n \\n56. The claimant provided copies to Mr McDonald, explaining their relevance \\nto the different allegations (as above) and Mr McDonald read these during \\nthe hearing.    \\n \\n57. The claimant added in his defence that in 12 years of being there and 30 \\nyears of being a pro he had never had an allegation against him.  Mr \\nMcDonald said that he would go away and check and the claimant offered \\nthat any of his witnesses would be willing to come forward.  Mr McDonald \\nstated in response that from his perspective, a witness statement from Ms \\nVirgo or Mr Virgo, with whom the claimant was close, ‘would be taken with \\na pinch of salt ’.   \\n \\n58. In closing the hearing, Mr McDonald said he would need to check the \\ndates and that everything does check out and that he would try to do so \\nthat evening rather than it dragging on.   \\n \\n59. In his evidence at the hearing, Mr McDonald confirmed that he reviewed \\nthe CCTV footage of Spikes Bar again after the disciplinary hearing and \\nlooked at footage for Tuesday 12, 19 and 26 April and Tuesday 3 and 10 \\nMay.  There is one still photo from the CCTV footage for each evening (at \\nvarying times between 18.00 and 19.00)  included in the bundle at pages \\n67 and 68. Mr McDonald confirmed in evidence at the hearing that he had \\nreviewed the footage of the whole evening in each case and confirmed \\nthat the CCTV did not contain any sound.  Mr McDonald also confirmed in \\nevidence that he did not speak to the claimant’s witnesses. \\n \\n60. A letter confirming the decision to dismiss the claimant with immediate \\neffect and the reasons for this was sent by Mr McDonald to the claimant \\non 7 June 2022.   The letter set out the decision with reference to the two \\nallegations set out in invitation letter (above).  The finding on the first \\nallegation was that whilst on and off duty the claimant made ‘ unwanted \\nadvances of a sexual nature to fellow employees ‘ and that ‘ the \\ncommunication taken place amounts to an assault of an indecent nature’  \\nand represents ‘ a gross breach of trust and confidence and breach of our \\nduty of care to provide a safe working environment to our employees .’ \\n \\n61. On the second allegation the finding was that in Spikes Bar the claimant \\n’made unwanted statements in reference to a fellow colleague having a \\nresemblance to Jimmy Saville ’ and that this ‘ amounts to bullying and \\nharassment that has caused mental discomfort amounting to an assault ’ \\nand represents ‘ a gross breach of trust and confidence and breach of our \\nduty of care to provide a safe working environment to our employees .’ \\n \\n62. The letter included specific findings on three allegations that were relied \\non as the reason for dismissal, and as confirmed by Mr McDonald in his \\nevidence at the hearing, as follows: \\n \\ni)  the facebook message sent to Ms Clark at 11pm on 8 March 2022;  \\nii)  the ‘lick you all over’ comment made to Ms Clark; and  \\niii) the behaviour of relating a fellow member of staff to Jimmy Saville. \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017  \\n63. Mr McDonald’s findings on each of the grounds relied on, as explained in \\nthe letter were that: \\n \\ni)  the claimant did send the facebook message to Ms Clark at 11.30pm \\n(though accepted at the hearing it was 11pm)  and that although the \\nclaimant’s  explanation was that there was no innuendo, regardless of if \\nthe message contains any innuendo, the time it was sent and the content \\nmade a fellow employee feel uncomfortable;   \\n \\nii)  due to the fact that the above event took place and the claimant\\'s lack \\nof vision on what impact this could have on an individual and their \\npersonal relationship, it was his reasonable belief that the denied \\ncomment also took place; \\n \\nii)  the claimant accepted the Jimmy Saville comment did take place but \\nsaid that the date was incorrect; that he had reviewed the CCTV for the \\ndates in April as suggested by the statements the claimant provided and \\nthat they were not in the place indicated and Ms Wilkins was not in the bar \\non any of those dates, which indicates that they refer to a separate \\nincident or contain false and misleading information. \\n \\n64. In conclusion Mr McDonald states in the letter that the claimant\\'s conduct \\nhas resulted in a fundamental breach of his contractual terms which \\nirrevocably destroys the trust and confidence necessary to continue the \\nemployment relationship.  He states the appropriate sanction for this \\nbreach is summary dismissal and that he has referred to the company’s \\ndisciplinary procedure when making his decision, which does not permit \\nrecourse to a lesser disciplinary sanction.  I find that Mr McDonald did not \\nconsider any lesser sanction and there was no evidence that he \\nconsidered the claimant\\'s mitigation mentioend at the discplinary hearing \\nregarding his length of service of 12 years and clean disciplinary record \\nwith no previous misconduct, when making his decision \\n \\n65. At the hearing, in relation to the ‘lick you’ comment, Mr McDonald \\naccepted that there was no independent evidence and this was also a \\ncase of ‘he said/she said’ and in pursuing it nonetheless said there was \\nevidence both ways in that the claimant had accepted that comments had \\nbeen made and there was the message on facebook. \\n \\n66. When first put to him that the claimant was dismissed for making the ‘lick \\nyou all over’ comment, Mr McDonald said he was not dismissed for that \\ncomment but for making ‘unwanted advances’.  When cross examined on \\nthe findings in the dismissal letter that there were two allegations by Ms \\nClark relied on and that Mr McDonald found the two complaints were well \\nfounded, he then agreed stating that the claimant admitted them.  He \\nqualified his evidence accepting that the claimant denied the specific \\ncomment, that is he did not use that exact wording but that he had \\nadmitted to making comments about Ms Clark’s appearance. \\n \\n67. Mr McDonald accepted and I find that there were several matters he never \\nasked about or put to Ms Clark including the claimant’s questions on the \\ntime and date of the comment and witnesses to it;  and the reason for the \\nbreakdown in their working relationship and the timing of raising her \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 complaint. He accepted that the grievance was raised on the same day \\nthat the claimant referred to Ms Clark in an email as ‘the receptionist’ and \\nthat by the time the grievance was raised by Ms Clark their working \\nrelationship was not good. He said he took into account that their \\nrelationship was poor but did not ask her about this. He believed it was a \\ngenuine grievance.  \\n \\n68. Mr McDonald accepted in evidence at the hearing when referred to the \\ncompany disciplinary policy (pages 59 and 60) that if considering the \\nfacebook message to Ms Clark alone, it would not meet the threshold of \\ngross misconduct. He confirmed that he would have regarded it as serious \\nmisconduct because of the time of the message and content and that it \\nwould be a level down as an isolated incident.  Under the respondent’s \\ndisciplinary policy the sanction for which is a final written warning.  He \\nstated that in relation to the disciplinary policy it was his view that sexual \\nharassment falls within gross misconduct, because safe-guarding staff is \\none of the most important obligations that you have as an employer.  \\n \\n69. It was put to Mr McDonald in cross examination that he had received and \\ninvestigated a complaint about the claimant likening himself to Jimmy \\nSaville and dismissed the claimant for a different complaint of likening a \\nfellow employee to Jimmy Saville.   \\n \\n70. Mr McDonald accepted that there were two different comments and that \\nMr Sloman’s statement did not align with the reason for dismissal.  His \\nreasoning was that the claimant said in his statement that he was not \\nreferring to himself but to a colleague, so in his view he was talking about \\nhimself or Joel as like Jimmy Saville and the intent was the same and that \\ngiven the claimant had such statements from his own peers, Mr McDonald \\nwas inclined to go with that interpretation.  I find that based on the written \\nevidence in the bundle the claimant did not say in his statement or during \\nthe disciplinary investigation that he referred to his colleague but that one \\nof the group he was with referred to Joel.  \\n \\n71. It was put to Mr McDonald that there were multiple accounts saying \\nsomething slightly different.  Mr McDonald disagreed that there were \\ndifferences between Ms Wilkins’ and Mr Sloman’s account.  He accepted \\nthere were variations in relation to the claimant\\'s evidence that a comment \\nat Joel’s expense was made when the ‘drinking club’ met on a Tuesday in \\nApril. In his view this showed the frequency that Jimmy Saville was \\nbrought up, and that ‘yes, someone made a comment about Joel’ but he \\ndid not think it was relevant because it was another incident.  In his view \\nthe claimant\\'s witnesses were not talking about the same thing and there \\nwas clearly more than one occasion the drinking club were talking about \\nJimmy Saville. \\n \\n72. The claimant denied in evidence that he and the drinking club spoke \\nfrequently about Jimmy Saville and denied that they did so on 10 May \\n2022, and that the conversation about Jimmy Saville and comment about \\nJoel occurred on 12 April 2022, when the drinking club including Joel met \\nin Spike’s bar, as could be seen on the CCTV footage. \\n \\n73. In his witness statement Mr McDonald stated that the claimant\\'s witnesses \\nwere not independent and were good friends of the claimant.  In his \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 evidence at the hearing he denied that he took into account evidence from \\nMr Sloman as a friend of Ms Wilkins but not of the claimant\\'s friends, \\nsaying that he took both sets of evidence at face value, which is why he \\nwent back and watched hours of CCTV footage for earlier dates in April, \\nas suggested by the claimant\\'s witnesses. He stated that the reason he \\ndid not place any weight on their evidence was because it was factually \\nincorrect. \\n \\n74. On it being put to him that it was the claimant’s case that all the relevant \\npeople were in the bar on 12 April 2022 and that Ms Wilkins was there that \\nevening, Mr McDonald disagreed. In reference to Ms Virgo’s statement \\nprovided by the claimant in which she said that Ms Wilkins was sitting \\nacross the bar when the conversation happened in April, Mr McDonald \\nsaid that he had watched the CCTV and Ms Wilkins was not there and Mr \\nSloman was not there on the evening in April. Therefore he could factually \\ndisprove the statements and that was why they carried no weight and he \\nwas not saying they were false but that he believed that they referred to \\nanother occasion on 12 April 2022 when Joel walked into the bar, rather \\nthan to 10 May 2022.  \\n \\n75. It was put to Mr McDonald that in her grievance statement, Ms Violo-Hitch \\nsaid that she was in Spike’s bar after work on 10 May 2022 and when \\nasked whether he ever asked her about it, he said in his evidence:  ‘ no \\nbecause she was not there at the time the conversation took place, so \\nwhilst there earlier [he] did not believe she was there when the comment \\nwas made ’. \\n \\n76. In giving her evidence at the hearing, Ms Violo-Hitch confirmed with \\nreference to the CCTV footage of 10 May 2022 that she was the person \\nsitting at the table with Ms Wilkins and her children.  When asked about \\nwhether the claimant made any comments, she said it was a reference to \\nhim likening himself to Jimmy Saville and said that she was in the room \\nwhen the comment was made.   \\n \\n77. When asked if Mr McDonald asked her any questions about this, she said \\nthat once Ms Wilkins’ statement was given he did.    \\n \\n78. There is a conflict of evidence on this point. Ms Violo-Hitch\\'s evidence that \\nshe was asked questions about this by Mr McDonald, is directly \\ncontradicted by Mr McDonald’s evidence.   \\n \\n79. In raising her grievance, Ms Wilkins submitted her complaint to Ms Violo-\\nHitch, which Ms Violo-Hitch made reference to in her witness statement in \\nthese proceedings. In her witness statement, Ms Violo-Hitch also referred \\nto her own grievance and alleged comments made towards or about her \\nby the claimant on 10 May 2022 in Spike’s bar and to other comments \\nmade by the claimant that evening about staff in general. She did not \\nmake reference to Ms Wilkins nor to any comments relating to Jimmy \\nSaville made by the claimant that same evening nor to being asked about \\nthis by Mr McDonald.  The first time she mentioned it was in giving \\nevidence at the hearing. \\n \\n80. Given the lack of any notes taken by Mr McDonald of any conversations \\nhe had during the investigation including this one and the number of \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 matters about which he failed to question the individual complainants, I \\nfind on balance that his evidence on this issue is consistent with his not \\nconducting interviews or taking any witness statements during the \\ninvestigation and that neither did he ask Ms Violo-Hitch about her \\npresence in the bar on 10 May 2022 or about the Jimmy Saville comment \\nand that her evidence on this point is unreliable.   \\n \\n \\nAppeal \\n81. The dismissal letter again contained errors in dates, referring to the \\ndisciplinary hearing held on 2 June (rather than 1 June) and referred to \\nappealing ‘ within two of receiving this letter ’.   On querying this the \\nclaimant was advised he had two days to appeal. \\n \\n82. The claimant appealed by letter dated 10 June 2022.  The appeal hearing \\nwas held on 16 June 2022 and chaired by Mr Flannagan, who was \\naccompanied by a note taker.  On inviting him to the appeal hearing, Mr \\nFlannagan summarised the grounds of appeal in the invitation letter as \\nfollows: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 “You feel the time the message was stated as wrong was incorrect \\nand that it is not unreasonable to send messages at the time in \\nwhich the message was sent  \\n\\uf0b7 Amanda was not uncomfortable from the message as no innuendo \\nwas involved but it was in fact work differences that eroded the \\nworking relationship  \\n\\uf0b7 The claims of “licking her all over” are fabricated  \\n\\uf0b7 The comment about Jimmy Saville was made but was not made by \\nyourself but one of your group and that evidence provided by \\nyourself supports this” \\n \\n83. The respondent did not take or produce any notes taken during the appeal \\nhearing and as the claimant had not been provided with notes of the \\ndisciplinary hearing, he recorded the meeting and a transcript was \\nprovided for these proceedings (pages 135 to 147). \\n \\n84. At the appeal hearing, Mr Flannagan confirmed he was there to hear the \\nreasons for the claimant\\'s appeal as summarised in the invitation letter \\nand referred to the charges set out in the disciplinary outcome letter.  The \\nclaimant set out his position on the three allegations found against him in \\nthe disciplinary letter and his grounds of appeal as summarised by Mr \\nFlannagan above. \\n \\n85. He referred to his evidence produced at the disciplinary hearing and Mr \\nFlannagan confirmed he had copies of this evidence and had read it.  The \\nclaimant also produced a further witness statement from Mr Roitman (a \\nmember) in relation to the conversation relating to Jimmy Saville in Spikes \\nbar, which Mr Roitman said did not take place on 10 May 2023. \\n \\n86. Mr Flannagan asked if he was satisfied with the process and procedure \\nand the claimant pointed out the several errors in letters sent to him, that \\nhe was not informed of the allegations against him prior to the first \\ninvestigation meeting so was unable to prepare and was given only one \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 day’s notice for the disciplinary hearing and was not given enough time, \\nwith 24 hours being the bare minimum.   \\n \\n87. He also made the point that in relation to Ms Wilkins’ allegation that there \\nwas a contradiction in what was said and the reason for the dismissal, that \\nMs Wilkins said one thing and he was dismissed for another thing.  He \\nfurther pointed out that his witnesses confirmed that the date is wrong and \\nthat he never said anything and that despite the finding in the dismissal \\nletter, that he has not admitted to making any comment and yet he was \\ndismissed for doing so, so he felt that his witness statements had been \\ncast aside and not taken into account. \\n \\n88. On 20 June 2022 a letter confirming the outcome of the appeal was sent \\nto the claimant.  Mr Flannagan confirmed that having given the matter full \\nconsideration, the original decision taken by Mr McDonald was upheld. \\n \\n89. The claimant states in his witness statement that in previous years he was \\nusually paid holiday he was owed but was unable to take holiday in 2021 \\nand was not paid for it due to cash flow issues and it was agreed he could \\ncarry it forward.  He claims he is also owed holiday accrued in 2022.  The \\nclaimant was not challenged on this in cross examination. Mr McDonald \\nstates in his witness statement that the claimant was paid for all holiday up \\nto the date of termination. There was no evidence before me in the bundle \\nof records for holiday taken by the claimant in 2021 or 2022 or of being \\npaid for all holiday owed to him up to the date of termination.   \\n \\nFindings for purpose of wrongful dismissal \\n90. For the purposes of the wrongful dismissal/breach of contract claim, I must \\nconsider my own view.   \\n \\n91. I find that the claimant sent a facebook message to Ms Clark, a work \\ncolleague and that the timing and content of the email, was inappropriate.  \\nI find that the claimant’s explanation that he meant no innuendo and was \\nreferencing that she was well turned out and smart at work did not mitigate \\nor excuse his conduct in sending a private message late at night. I further \\nfind that his inability or unwillingness to accept or acknowledge that \\nreceiving such a message, notwithstanding his intention, from a senior \\ncolleague late at night whilst at home, may be inappropriate and make Ms \\nClark feel uncomfortable, exacerbates the offence. \\n \\n92. I am not persuaded on the basis of the evidence from the investigation \\nand before me in the tribunal and do not find that the claimant made the \\ncomment alleged in the pro golf shop to Ms Clark. There was no other \\ndocumentary or witness evidence from the disciplinary investigation to \\nsupport Ms Clark’s grievance statement and she was not called as a \\nwitness at the tribunal. The claimant strongly denied making the comment \\nat the time and in the tribunal. I will discuss this further in my conclusions.  \\n \\n93. I am also not persuaded on the evidence heard and do not find that the \\nclaimant made a comment referring to Joel Rickardson as resembling \\nJimmy Saville in Spike’s Bar on 10 May 2022.  I find that the evidence \\nfrom the investigation and before me in the tribunal did not support this for \\nthe reasons set out in my findings above.  I will discuss this further in my \\nconclusions.  \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 Law  \\n \\nUnfair dismissal \\n \\n94. The relevant provisions in relation to an unfair dismissal claim are \\nfound in section 98 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. Under s.98 \\n(2)(b) a reason which ‘relates to the conduct of the employee’ is a \\npotentially fair reason for dismissal.  The question of whether it is fair or \\nunfair appears in section 98(4):  \\n“…The determination of the question whether the dismissal is fair or unfair \\n(having regard to the reason shown by the employer) –  \\n(a) depends on whether in the circumstances (including the size and \\nadministrative resources of the employer’s undertaking) the employer \\nacted reasonably or unreasonably in treating it as a sufficient reason for \\ndismissing the employee, and  \\n(b) shall be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial \\nmerits of the case.”  \\n \\n95. In British Home Stores v Burchell [1980] ICR 303,  Mr Justice Arnold \\nidentified three considerations which arise in misconduct cases. Firstly, did \\nthe employer have a genuine belief that the employee was guilty of the \\nmisconduct in question? Secondly, was that belief based on reasonable \\ngrounds? Thirdly, had that belief been formed following such investigation \\ninto the matter as was reasonable in all the circumstances? This is \\ncommonly referred to as the ‘Burchell test’.  \\n \\n96. If in appplying the Burchell test the answer to the questions posed is \\nyes, the Tribunal must still determine whether the decision of the employer \\nto dismiss the employee rather than impose a different disciplinary \\nsanction (or no sanction at all) was a reasonable one.  The Tribunal must \\nnot substitute its own view for that of the employer. \\n \\n97. In considering the fairness of the dismissal the appeal should be \\ntreated as part and parcel of the dismissal process: Taylor v OCS Group \\nLimited [2006] ICR 1602.   \\n \\n98. In the employment context “gross misconduct” is commonly used as \\nshorthand for conduct which amounts to a repudiatory breach of the \\ncontract of employment entitling the employer to terminate it without \\nnotice. In the unfair dismissal context, however, a finding of gross \\nmisconduct does not automatically mean that dismissal is a reasonable \\nresponse. An employer should consider whether dismissal would be \\nreasonable after considering any mitigating circumstances: Brito-\\nBabapulle v Ealing Hospital NHS Trust [2013] IRLR 854.   \\n \\n99. Exactly what type of behaviour amounts to gross misconduct will \\ndepend upon the facts of the individual case.  \\n \\n100. It follows that in the statutory context of section 98(4), even if the \\nBurchell test is met, the Tribunal must still consider the following:  \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 a. Whether the employer acted within the band of reasonable responses in \\nchoosing to characterise the misconduct as gross misconduct, and if so  \\nb. Whether the employer acted within the band of reasonable responses in \\ndeciding that the appropriate sanction for that gross misconduct was \\ndismissal.  \\n \\n101. On the latter question the employee’s length of service and disciplinary \\nrecord are relevant (Trusthouse Forte (Catering) Limited v Adonis \\n[1984] IRLR 382)  as well as the attitude of the employee to his conduct \\n(Paul v East Surrey District Health Authority [1995] IRLR 305 ). \\n \\nPolkey \\n102. I must also consider any procedural unfairness and if I conclude \\nthat the claimant had been unfairly dismissed, I should consider whether \\nany adjustment should be made to the compensation on the grounds that \\nif a fair process had been followed by the respondent in dealing with the \\nclaimant’s case, the claimant might have been fairly dismissed, in \\naccordance with the principles in Polkey v AE Dayton Services Ltd [1987] \\nUKHL 8.    \\n103. In undertaking this exercise, I am not assessing what I would have \\ndone; I am assessing what this employer would or might have done. I \\nmust assess the actions of the employer before me, on the assumption \\nthat the employer would this time have acted fairly though it did not do so \\nbeforehand: Hill v Governing Body of Great Tey Primary School [2013] \\nIRLR 274 at para 24  \\nContributory Fault   \\n104. The Tribunal may reduce the basic or compensatory awards for \\nculpable conduct in the slightly different circumstances set out in sections \\n122(2) and 123(6) of the Employment Rights Act 1996.  \\n105. Section 122(2) provides as follows: “ Where the Tribunal considers \\nthat any conduct of the complainant before the dismissal (or, where the \\ndismissal was with notice, before the notice was given) was such that it \\nwould be just and equitable to reduce or further reduce the amount of the \\nbasic award to any extent, the Tribunal shall reduce or further reduce that \\namount accordingly.”  \\n106. Section 123(6) then provides that: “ Where the Tribunal finds that \\nthe dismissal was to any extent caused or contributed to by any action of \\nthe complainant, it shall reduce the amount of the compensatory award by \\nsuch proportion as it considers just and equitable having regard to that \\nfinding.” \\n107. In the case of s.123 this is a mandatory duty for the tribunal to \\nconsider even if the issue is not expressly raised by the parties ( Swallow \\nSecurity Services Ltd v Millicent UKEAT/0279/08 ).  The conduct does not \\nneed to amount to a breach of contract or gross misconduct, the three \\nfactors that must be present are that the conduct must be culpable or \\nblameworthy, it must have actually caused or contributed to the dismissal \\nand the reduction must be just and equitable ( Nelson v BBC(No.2) [1979 \\nIRLR 346 (CA) \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 ACAS uplift  \\n108. The Claimant alleges breaches of the ACAS Code – if found, the \\nquestion arises whether any adjustment should be made under section \\n207A(2) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act \\n1992 for failure to follow the requirements of the ACAS Code of Practice \\non Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures.   A mere failure to follow the \\nAcas Code will not be sufficient, it must be unreasonable.  If so, the \\ntribunal must consider whether it is just and equitable to award an uplift \\nand if so by what percentage up to 25%. \\nWrongful Dismissal \\n \\n109. I must decide if the claimant committed an act of gross misconduct \\nentitling it to dismiss without notice. In distinction to the claimant’s claim of \\nunfair dismissal, where the focus is on the reasonableness of the \\nrespondent’s decisions, and it is immaterial what decision I would myself \\nhave made about the claimant’s conduct, I must decide for myself whether \\nthe claimant was guilty of conduct serious enough to entitle the \\nrespondent to terminate the employment without notice.    \\n110. In Briscoe v Lubrizol Ltd 2002 IRLR 607, CA , the Court of Appeal \\napproved the test set out in Neary and anor v Dean of Westminster 1999 \\nIRLR 288 , Special Commissioner (Westminster Abbey), where Lord \\nJauncey asserted that the conduct ‘ must so undermine the trust and \\nconfidence which is inherent in the particular contract of employment that \\nthe [employer] should no longer be required to retain the [employee] in his \\nemployment ’. The Court of Appeal in Briscoe stressed that the employee’s \\nconduct should be viewed objectively, and so an employee can repudiate \\nthe contract even without an intention to do so. \\n111. A court or tribunal must be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, \\nthat there was an actual repudiation of the contract by the employee.  \\n112. It is not enough for an employer to prove that it had a reasonable \\nbelief that the employee was guilty of gross misconduct. This is a different \\nstandard from that required of employers resisting a claim of unfair \\ndismissal, where reasonable belief may suffice. \\n113. Since the question of whether an employee is in repudiatory breach \\nis a matter of fact, the employer’s motivation for wanting to summarily \\ndismiss is effectively irrelevant. In Williams v Leeds United Football Club \\n2015 IRLR 383, QBD , \\n \\n114. The issue of whether misconduct by an employee amounts to a \\nrepudiation may turn on the terms of his or her contract of employment.  In \\nDietmann v Brent London Borough Council 1988 ICR 842, CA ,  \\nHoliday Pay – Working Time Regulations 1998 \\n115. The Working Time Regulations 1998 provide for minimum periods of \\nannual leave and for payment to be made in lieu of any leave accrued but \\nnot taken in the leave year in which the employment ends.  \\n116. Reg 13 and 13A provide for 5.6 weeks leave per annum. Reg 14 \\nprovides for payment of accrued untaken leave payable on termination.   \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 CONCLUSIONS  \\n117. I will address each of the agreed issues in the case separately, but \\neach conclusion has been drawn having taken account of the whole of the \\nevidence in the case, both written and oral.  \\n \\nUnfair Dismissal  \\n118. I remind myself it is not for the Tribunal to substitute it’s own view \\nfor that of the respondent. I must satisfy myself that the dismissal fell \\nwithin the range of reasonable responses. \\n \\nTurning to the list of issues: \\n \\nHas the Respondent shown the reason for dismissal?  \\n119. It is for the respondent to establish the reason for dismissal. In it’s \\nresponse to the claim, the respondent says the reason for dismissal is \\ngross misconduct for ‘ unwanted advances of a sexual nature to fellow \\nemployees ‘ and ‘unwanted statements in reference to a fellow colleague \\nhaving a resemblance to Jimmy Saville ’. The respondent relies on three \\nallegations discussed at the disciplinary hearing and set out in the \\ndismissal letter.   \\n \\n120. There was a 4th allegation discussed in the disciplinary hearing \\nregarding the message sent to Ms Wilkins in February 2022, which was \\npart of the investigation but was not cited in the dismissal letter as a \\nreason for dismissal. Regarding the fourth allegation Mr McDonald \\nconceded and I conclude that the reason for dismissal was the claimant’s \\nconduct based on the three allegations set out in the dismissal letter, \\nwhich the respondent categorised as gross misconduct.  \\n \\n121. The claimant had suggested at the time and in his claim that he \\nbelieved his dismissal was pre-determined and that there was an intention \\nto force him out, as he had refused to take a pay cut and the respondent \\nhad financial difficulties.  I do not accept this assertion and accept that \\nthere are no other reasons for dismissal other than conduct.   \\n \\nWas the reason a potentially fair reason of a kind that can justify \\n dismissal under sections 98(1) and (2) of the Employment \\nRights Act 1996 (ERA)?  \\n \\n122. Conduct is a potentially fair reason for dismissal under s.98(2)(b) \\nERA. \\n \\nIf so, was the dismissal fair or unfair within section 98(4), and did the \\nrespondent in all respects act within the band of reasonable \\nresponses?    \\n \\n123. Following the test in BHS v Burchell test, I must answer the \\nfollowing questions: \\n \\nDid the Respondent genuinely believe the Claimant was guilty of \\ngross misconduct?  \\n \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 124. I conclude from the written evidence and oral evidence at the \\nhearing that Mr McDonald considered the three allegations to be serious \\nand categorised them as unwanted conduct that was sexual in nature and \\nunwanted statements re Jimmy Saville as bullying and harassment and he \\nalso referred in evidence to sexual harassment. I find that considering \\nthem as such, he believed that the claimant’s conduct amounted to gross \\nmisconduct because on his view the safe-guarding of staff is a key \\nobligation of an employer.  \\n \\nDid the Respondent hold that belief based on reasonable grounds?  \\n125. In considering whether the respondent\\'s belief that the claimant \\nwas guilty of gross misconduct was based on reasonable grounds, I will \\ntake each of the three allegations on which Mr McDonald relied in turn: \\n \\nSpikes Bar on 10 May 2022  – ‘making unwanted statements in reference \\nto a fellow colleague resembling Jimmy Saville ’ \\n \\n126. The original allegation by Ms Wilkins, as put to the claimant at the \\ndisciplinary investigation meeting, was that on 10 May 2022 in Spike’s Bar \\nthe claimant was speaking about himself and made comments about \\nJimmy Saville. This was supported by a statement obtained by Mr \\nMcDonald from Mr Sloman, of the claimant likening himself to Jimmy \\nSaville.  \\n \\n127. The evidence of comments about Jimmy Saville being made in \\nreference to a fellow employee came from the claimant during the \\ndisciplinary investigation meeting;  he recalled that comments were made \\nto Joel Rickardson by one of the ‘drinking club’ members and that this did \\nnot happen on 10 May 2022 but on 12 April 2022. This was subsequently \\nsupported by two witness statements provided by the claimant at the \\ndisciplinary hearing and a third at the appeal hearing.  \\n \\n128. Throughout the investigation the claimant denied that he made \\ncomments likening himself or a colleague to Jimmy Saville, saying it was a \\nmember of the group who referred to a colleague (Joel Rickardson) on 12 \\nApril 2022 during the netflix conversation. He also denied that the group \\nwere talking about Jimmy Saville again on 10 May 2023, which was \\ncorroborated by Ms Virgo. \\n \\n129. In inviting the claimant to the disciplinary hearing, the allegation \\nregarding Spike’s Bar was set out in the invitation letter for the first time as \\nmaking ‘unwanted comments with reference to a fellow employee \\nresembling Jimmy Saville’, and later repeated as the reason for dismissal. \\nIt was submitted by Ms Webber that the respondent investigated one \\ncomplaint but dismissed the claimant for another.  Mr McDonald’s \\nreasoning for this was that as the evidence from the claimant and the \\nclaimant\\'s peers was that Jimmy Saville was discussed with reference to a \\ncolleague but not himself, he considered the intent was the same and so \\nwas ‘inclined to go with that interpretation’.  \\n \\n130. Mr McDonald was equally clear that he considered that the \\nclaimant\\'s statement and his witnesses’ statements, were evidence that \\nJimmy Saville was discussed on more than one occasion. By contrast,  \\ntherefore, he placed no weight on their witness statements, as they were \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 ‘factually incorrect’ and related to an incident on 12 April 2022 and in his \\nview were not relevant to the complaint made by Ms Wilkins on 10 May \\n2022. \\n \\n131. Taking account of all of the evidence, I conclude that Mr \\nMcDonald’s findings and belief that the claimant was guilty of making \\nunwanted statements in reference to a fellow employee resembling Jimmy \\nSaville on 10 May 2022 in the presence of Ms Wilkins, which was bullying \\nand harassment, was not based on reasonable grounds for the reasons \\nthat follow.  \\n \\n132. The evidence relied on Mr McDonald from Mr Sloman does not \\nsupport his finding, referring as it does to the claimant likening himself to \\nJimmy Saville; by his own admission he placed no weight on the evidence \\nof the claimant’s witnesses as it related to another occasion on 12 April \\n2022 and so he considered it not relevant to Ms Wilkins’ complaint on 10 \\nMay; yet he relied on their ‘interpretation’ of the conversation on 12 April \\n2022 as the reason for dismissal relating to the complaint about events on \\n10 May 2022;  by his further admission he satisfied himself from the CCTV \\nfootage that Ms Wilkins and her children were not in Spike’s bar on 12 \\nApril 2022 and that Joel Rickardson (about whom the comment was \\nmade) was not present in Spike’s bar on 10 May 2022;  and he did not \\ninterview anyone else in Spike\\'s Bar on 10 May 2022 (as seen in CCTV \\nfootage) including Ms Violo-Hitch whom he acknowledged was in the bar \\nthat evening. \\n \\n133. I have carefully considered Mr McDonald’s explanation that whether \\nthe claimant was likening himself or a colleague to Jimmy Saville the intent \\nwas the same, as his explanation for adopting their interpretation in  \\nfinding against the claimant in relation to Ms Wilkins’ complaint. I have \\nconsidered whether this was a reasonable ground to sustain a belief in the \\nclaimant’s gross misconduct as detailed in the dismissal letter, given the \\nevidence before him. Given the inconsistencies and contradictions in Mr \\nMcDonald’s approach to and weighing of the complaint and the evidence, I \\nconclude that this was not sufficient reason to sustain a belief on \\nreasonable grounds that the claimant was guilty of the allegation of gross \\nmisconduct set out in the dismissal letter. \\n \\nfacebook message sent to Ms Clark at 11pm on 8 March 2022  \\n \\n134. It was not in dispute that the claimant sent the facebook message \\ncommenting on her appearance to Ms Clark at approximately 11pm at \\nnight. Ms Clark was married, the message was sent late at night and it \\nwas Mr McDonald’s view that she brought it up with management because \\nshe felt uncomfortable.   \\n \\n135. The claimant did not accept that the content or timing of the \\nmessage to a work colleague was inappropriate, a position he maintained \\nat the hearing. Mr McDonald’s reason for finding against the claimant on \\nthis issue was that whether or not the message contained any innuendo, \\nthe timing and content of the message made Ms Clark uncomfortable.   \\n \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 136. I conclude that Mr McDonald’s finding that the content and timing of \\nthe message made Ms Clark uncomfortable and amounted to misconduct \\nwas based on reasonable grounds. \\n \\n137. Mr McDonald accepted that if looking at this allegation alone, he \\nwould consider it a matter of serious rather than gross misconduct. I shall \\nreturn to this issue below. \\n \\n‘You smell so good I could lick you all over’ comment made to Ms \\nClark – ‘ unwanted advances of a sexual nature’  \\n \\n138. In the dismissal letter Mr McDonald’s reason for finding that this \\ncomment took place was due to the facebook message sent by the \\nclaimant and the lack of vision shown by the claimant in understanding the \\nimpact of sending that message on Ms Clark’s personal relationship. \\n \\n139. In the hearing Mr McDonald also gave as grounds for this finding \\nthat the claimant had admitted to making comments on Ms Clark’s \\nappearance but not to using those exact words.  \\n \\n140. During the investigation and as he maintained at the tribunal \\nhearing, the claimant had admitted to complimenting Ms Clark on the front \\nof house staff being smart and that she was always well turned out. He \\ndenied that he made the comment ‘lick you all over’ and I find that he \\nrepeatedly asked Mr McDonald for the time and date it took place and any \\nwitnesses.  \\n \\n141. At the disciplinary investigation meeting, Mr McDonald cited Ms \\nClark’s grievance as being the primary complaint. It was accepted by Ms \\nWebber in her submission that this was a very serious allegation that if \\nproven, would be an act of sexual harassment. It was further submitted \\nthat being denied by the claimant, such a serious allegation would need a \\nstrong basis for the respondent to conclude it did occur.  \\n \\n142. Mr McDonald accepted that he had no independent evidence in \\nsupport of this allegation and I find that despite stating that he would follow \\nup with Ms Clark after the disciplinary investigation meeting, Mr McDonald \\nfailed to do so. I have found that he never asked Ms Clark about the date \\nand time the comment was made and never asked about the colleagues \\nwho were witness to it, which she had stated in her written complaint and \\nhe was unable to establish who was on duty at the time, as he did not \\nknow or enquire about the date. \\n \\n143. I find that the failure to question Ms Clark, either on receiving the \\ngrievance, to ask about the time and date the alleged comment took place \\nor to make enquiries about witnesses mentioned in her written statement, \\nand the failure to follow up after the disciplinary investigation meeting with \\nthe claimant, was not within the range of reasonable responses.  \\n \\n144. I have reminded myself that I must not substitute my own view for \\nthat of the respondent and have carefully considered whether in the \\nabsence of such initial or further investigations on such a serious \\nallegation, Mr McDonald’s belief based on the facebook message and \\nprevious comments on Ms Clark’s appearance in being smart and well \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 turned out, was nonetheless reasonable grounds for finding the claimant \\nguilty of making the ‘lick you all over’ comment. I conclude that it was not \\nand that Mr McDonald’s belief that the claimant was guilty of the \\nmisconduct was not based on reasonable grounds in the circumstances, \\nas outlined in my findings above and on the evidence heard. \\n \\nDid the respondent carry out a reasonable and sufficient   \\n investigation?  \\n \\n145. Based on my findings above and the written and oral evidence \\nheard, I conclude that the respondent did not carry out a reasonable and \\nsufficient investigation.  \\n \\n146. I have made findings above that there are a number of failings in \\nthe investigation. Mr McDonald failed to interview or re-interview the \\ncomplainants about details of their complaints, including on questions and \\nrepresentations made by the claimant during the disciplinary investigation. \\nHe failed to take notes of conversations he said he had on receiving the \\noriginal grievances and of his conversations with Mr Sloman and Joel \\nRickardson.  \\n \\n147. He did not interview other potential witnesses at the time, such as \\nMs Violo-Hitch regarding the Spike’s bar ‘Jimmy Saville’ complaint and did \\nnot interview the claimant’s witnesses or others in the bar on 10 May 2022 \\nincluding Ms Virgo, who was a former employee and willing to speak to \\nhim. Neither did he follow up on identifying or interviewing any potential \\nwitnesses in relation to the ‘lick you all over’ comment reported to take \\nplace in the pro golf shop in front of work colleagues.   \\n \\n148. He failed to follow up on the claimant\\'s explanation of the reason for \\nthe breakdown in the working relationship with Ms Clark due to work \\ndifferences or on emails suggested by the claimant as evidence of this \\nsuggested at the disciplinary investigation meeting.    \\n \\n149. I have carefully weighed whether Mr McDonald’s investigation was \\nnonetheless reasonable and sufficient and that it may be within the range \\nof reasonable responses, even if not every point is investigated. I conclude \\nthat in the circumstances it was not. The allegations were categorised as \\ngross misconduct by the respondent with serious consequences for the \\nclaimant. There were some basic yet fundamental details of the \\nallegations against the claimant, that he did not make enquiries about or \\nfurther investigate the details including the time and date and potential \\nwitnesses of the ‘lick you’ comment.  \\n \\n150. The appeal as part of the overall process did not address any of \\nthese failings as no further investigation was carried out for the purposes \\nof the appeal. \\n \\nWas the process procedurally fair?  \\n151. In considering whether the process was procedurally fair overall, I \\nhave found that: there were numerous errors in correspondence \\nthroughout the disciplinary investigation and process; there were no notes \\ntaken or provided to the claimant of any interviews or conversations with \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 witnesses; the claimant was not given access to or provided with any \\nCCTV footage despite asking; the claimant was given one day’s notice of \\nthe disciplinary hearing and had less than 24 hours to consider the written \\ncomplaints and evidence provided to him for the first time with the \\ninvitation letter; he asked for more time to prepare for the hearing and \\ngather information for his defence and arrange for someone to accompany \\nhim and his request was refused; he was given two days within which to \\nappeal against his dismissal; and that he was not provided with any notes \\nor a transcript of the disciplinary hearing prior to the appeal hearing. \\n \\n152. I find that the procedural matters outlined above were indicative of a \\nlack of attention to detail and due regard for a fair process, taking account \\nof the size and resources of the respondent, who had HR advice from \\nexternal providers, and having also outlined my findings on the \\ninvestigation above, which I have found was not sufficient or reasonable, I \\nconclude that given the number of deficiencies the process was not \\nreasonable and was procedurally unfair. \\n \\nWas the decision to dismiss a fair sanction i.e. within the range of \\nreasonable responses for a reasonable employer?  \\n \\n153. I have reminded myself that I must not substitute my view for that of \\nthe respondent and must consider whether dismissal was within the range \\nof reasonable responses for a reasonable employer and whether it was \\nreasonable for the respondent to categorise the Claimant’s conduct as \\ngross misconduct including with reference to its disciplinary policy. \\n \\n154. In summary, given my earlier conclusions when considering the \\nBurchell test that the investigation was not sufficient or reasonable, and  \\nmy conclusions that the belief that the claimant was guilty of misconduct \\nwas not based on reasonable grounds in two of the three allegations of \\nmisconduct relied on as the reason for the dismissal, I consider that the \\ndecision to dismiss was not a fair sanction within the range of reasonable \\nresponses that a reasonable the employer would take.  \\n \\n155. I found that the respondent did not carry out a reasonable or \\nsufficient investigation and that the respondent\\'s belief that the claimant \\nmade the ‘lick you all over’ comment was not based on reasonable \\ngrounds for the reasons stated above. \\n \\n156. I also found that the respondent’s belief that the claimant was guilty \\nof making the comment regarding a colleague’s resemblance to Jimmy \\nSaville on 10 May 2023 in Ms Wilkins presence was not based on \\nreasonable grounds for the reasons stated above.  \\n \\n157. This leaves the claimant’s conduct in sending the facebook \\nmessage, which if dealt with on its own rather than together with the other \\nallegations, Mr McDonald accepted was a level down as serious \\nmisconduct, for which as a first offence under the respondent\\'s disciplinary \\npolicy, the sanction is a final written warning.  \\n \\n158. I have nonetheless considered whether it was or would have been \\nwithin the range of reasonable responses for the respondent to dismiss \\nthe claimant on this ground in isolation.  I find that in light of Mr \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 McDonald’s evidence on the level of this offence and the appropriate \\nsanction and of the respondent\\'s disciplinary policy, it would not be within \\nthe range of reasonable responses of a reasonable employer to dismiss \\non that ground alone.   \\n \\n159. On these findings, I conclude that in light of all of the above \\nsummary dismissal was not a fair sanction and is not within the range of \\nreasonable responses for a reasonable employer and the claimant has \\nbeen unfairly dismissed. \\n \\nPolkey \\n160. Given my findings that the dismissal and the finding of gross \\nmisconduct was not sustainable and the decision to dismiss for gross \\nmisconduct was not a reasonable belief based on reasonable grounds, I \\ncannot say with any confidence that there is sufficient evidence to enable \\nme to reach a conclusion that the claimant would have been dismissed \\nfairly, as a percentage likelihood, if a fair process was followed.  There \\nshould be no polkey reduction. \\n \\nAcas Code  \\n161. A mere failure to follow the Acas Code will not be sufficient, it must \\nbe unreasonable.  If so, the tribunal must consider whether it is just and \\nequitable to award an uplift and if so by what percentage up to 25%. \\n \\n162. I have found that there were failings in the investigation including \\nfailures to carry out all necessary investigations to establish the facts and \\nto interview the complainants on key issues; failure to interview any of the \\nclaimant\\'s witnesses or to attempt to identify or interview other witnesses; \\nand failure to take notes or witness statements of conversations;  the \\nclaimant was given insufficient time to review evidence provided and to \\nprepare for the disciplinary hearing; the claimant was not provided with or \\ngiven access to CCTV despite asking. \\n \\n163. I find that the above failings were in breach of the Acas code and \\nwere in themselves unreasonable and I take account of the respondent\\'s \\nsize and resources and that they had the benefit of external advisors \\nthroughout the process.  I award an uplift of 20%. \\n \\nContributory  \\n164. There is no requirement for the conduct or action of the claimant to \\nbe gross misconduct for it to be relevant conduct for the purposes of s.122 \\nor s.123.  All that is required is for the conduct to be culpable, \\nblameworthy, foolish or similar and this includes conduct that falls short of \\ngross misconduct. \\n \\n165. I am obliged to consider under s.123 whether the claimant\\'s \\nconduct caused or contributed to his dismissal.  I have found that the \\nclaimant was guilty of serious misconduct in respect of sending the late \\nnight facebook message and I further found in my objective view that the \\noffence was exacerbated by his inability or unwillingness to acknowledge \\nany level of inappropriateness or discomfort caused to Ms Clark.   \\n \\n166. I find that this was blameworthy conduct and that it materially \\ncontributed to the dismissal, being one of the charges relied on as a \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 reason for dismissal.  It further contributed being a factor taken into \\naccount for the second charge of making the ‘lick you’ comment and even \\nthough I did not uphold that charge as reasonably founded, the claimant\\'s \\nconduct re the facebook message nonetheless materially contributed to \\nhis dismissal.  \\n \\n167. I have considered in light of the above whether it would be just and \\nequitable to reduce the basic and/or compensatory award. I consider that \\nthis is the case and that given the nature of the conduct and as a material \\ncontributory factor, the contribution should be more than minimal for the \\nreasons above and determine that the appropriate level of contribution is \\nby a reduction of 40% to the basic and compensatory award. \\n \\n168. In respect of s.122 the respondent asserts that the claimant’s \\nconduct in breaching the terms of his suspension by contacting friends \\nand associates (members and a former colleague) for witness statements \\nwas blameworthy conduct because he was expressly told not to make \\ncontact while under suspension and in Mr Hine’s submission also because \\nit was an attempt to derail and deflect the investigation from the May 10 \\nallegation to April.  It was also claimed that contacting others to remove \\nitems from the pro shop was blameworthy but no evidence or submissions \\nwere advanced on this.  I do not find that in the circumstances that the \\nclaimant’s conduct in this respect was such that it would be just and \\nequitable to further reduce the basic award and make no further reduction. \\n \\nWas the respondent entitled to summarily dismiss the claimant - Wrongful \\nDismissal? \\n \\n169. Finally, I must consider the claim for wrongful dismissal and \\nwhether on the evidence before the Tribunal, the claimant’s actions \\nwarrant summary dismissal.  I have given careful consideration to the \\nevidence before me and heard and read at the tribunal in reaching my \\ndecision and my findings set out at paragraph 90-93 above.  \\n \\n170. I found that the claimant was guilty of misconduct in sending a \\nfacebook message to Ms Clark late at night for the reasons stated above.  \\nI found on balance that he did not make the comment in the pro golf shop \\nand conclude that he was not guilty of misconduct in this regard.  The ‘lick \\nyou’ comment was of a different ilk to the facebook message and to his \\nadmission to comments made about Ms Clark’s smart appearance and \\nlooking good at work.  I find that if witnessed by colleagues in the pro golf \\nshop, as indicated in Ms Clark’s grievance statement, in a busy golf club \\nwhere staff and members socialised together, it would more likely than not \\nhave been discussed and come to the attention of other colleagues and \\nmanagement.   \\n \\n171. I found on balance that he did not make the comment in Spike’s bar \\non 10 May 2023 referring to Joel Rickardson as resembling Jimmy Saville \\nfor the reasons outlined above and conclude that he was not guilty of \\nmisconduct in this regard. There was a conflation of evidence relating to \\ntwo events on 12 April 2022 and 10 May 2022.  The claimant admitted to a \\nconversation on 12 April 2022 when a member of the group made such a \\ncomment, he denied making any comment himself on either 12 April 2022 \\nor 10 May 2022.  Ms Virgo’s evidence at the hearing supported this and \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 was consistent with her written statement at the time. I considered Ms \\nViolo-Hitch said for the first time at the hearing that a comment was made \\nby the claimant likening himself to Jimmy Saville on 10 May 2022.  On \\nbalance in the absence of any evidence that Ms Violo-Hitch had disclosed \\nthis at any stage of the investigation or in preparing her own witness \\nstatement for these proceedings, I give less weight to Ms Violo-Hitch\\'s \\nevidence, and prefer Ms Virgo’s evidence on this issue.   \\n \\n \\n172. Having concluded that two of the allegations of misconduct were \\nnot sustainable, and that the third allegation, as a first offence, was \\nregarded as serious meriting a final written warning but did not amount to \\ngross misconduct on its own, I conclude that the claimant\\'s conduct, \\nviewed objectively, was not a repudiatory breach of contract by the \\nclaimant and that it did not so undermine trust and confidence that the \\nrespondent was entitled to summarily dismiss the claimant and in doing \\nthe respondent was in breach of contract in summarily dismissing the \\nclaimant without notice or pay in lieu of notice. \\n \\nHoliday Pay \\n173.  The claimant makes a claim under the working time regulations for \\npayment in lieu of accrued untaken holiday on the termination of his \\nemployment. In submissions Miss Webber clarified the carry over from \\n2021 was limited to 8 days under regulation 13A and for 2022 a pro rata \\naccrual of 12 days to the termination date, so a total of 20 days.  In the \\nabsence of holiday records as to when holiday was taken and any invoices \\nsubmitted by the claimant including holiday or pay slips, on balance I find \\nthat the claimant is owed pay in lieu of untaken holiday. \\n \\n174. The matter will be listed for a remedy hearing that will take place in \\ndue course and any case management orders in that respect will be sent \\nto the parties separately. \\n \\n \\n     \\n Employment Judge K Hunt  \\n     \\nDate:  8/12/2023 \\n \\n \\n \\n    RESERVED JUDGMENT & REASONS SENT TO THE PARTIES ON \\n                                                              11 December 2023 \\n     ........................................................................................................... \\n                                                                \\n     ........................................................................................................... \\n    FOR EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNALS \\n \\n \\nPublic access to employment tribunal decisions \\n \\nJudgments and reasons for the judgments are published, in full, online at \\nwww.gov.uk/employment-tribunal-decisions shortly after a copy has been sent to the claimant(s) \\nand respondent(s) in a case. \\n \\n \\nRecording and Transcription \\n \\nCase No: 3312598/2022 \\n10.5 Reserved judgment with reasons – rule 62  March 2017 Please note that if a Tribunal hearing has been recorded you may request a transcript of the \\nrecording, for which a charge may be payable.
